# How to execute?

1. Install the zig compiler (on mac it is as simple as: `brew install zig`)
2. Go to this directory
3. Build and run the code with: `zig run main.zig`
4. To execute the tests: `zig test main.zig`

# What is expected to happen?

The program should execute, and the tests should pass. The expected message on
`zig test main.zig` is 'All 2 tests passed'.

Testing is an important feature of any new programming language. They have been
proved excellent to prevent errors, bugs and several programming errors.
